# mooncalc
 Simple (micro)Python library to compute  moon positions/phases etc


  Based on the excellent suncalc.js libray by Vladimir Agafonkin, a simple library to
  compute moon position, azimuth, altitude, phases, rise/set times etc.

  I needed this to run on micropython, so it has minimal dependencies.

  One could and should add sun set/rise times etc as well.

  II should be noted that the computed data is different from what can be looked at
  mooncalc.org. Not much, but about 1-2 degrees. I'm not sure if mooncalc.org is more
  correct or not.
